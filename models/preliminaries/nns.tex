\begin{definition}[Fully Connected Layer]
    Let $A \in \mathbb R^{n \times m}$ and $b \in \mathbb R^m$. We call the mapping

        $$ F: \mathbb R^{n} \to \mathbb R^{m} ~, ~~ F(x) = Ax + b ~, $$

    a fully connected layer.
\end{definition}

In order to refer to the architecture,
thats is a fully connected layer with input dimension $n \in \mathbb N$ and output dimension $m \in \mathbb N$,
whose weights are not fixed but subject to optimization, 
we write $F(n, m)$.
