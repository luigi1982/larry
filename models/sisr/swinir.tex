The SWinIR model proposed by Liang et al. \cite{liangSwinIRImageRestoration2021a}, 
makes use of the shifted window transfomer architecture introduced by Liu et al. \cite{liangSwinIRImageRestoration2021a}.
While the model does not employ the hierarchical structure of the original architecture, 
it makes extensive use of the shifted window mechanism.
The model architecture is depicted in figure \ref{fig:swinir_model}.
