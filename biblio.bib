  abstract = {The transformer is a neural network component that can be used to learn useful representations of sequences or sets of data-points. The transformer has driven recent advances in natural language processing, computer vision, and spatio-temporal modelling. There are many introductions to transformers, but most do not contain precise mathematical descriptions of the architecture and the intuitions behind the design choices are often also missing. Moreover, as research takes a winding path, the explanations for the components of the transformer can be idiosyncratic. In this note we aim for a mathematically precise, intuitive, and clean description of the transformer architecture. We will not discuss training as this is rather standard. We assume that the reader is familiar with fundamental topics in machine learning including multi-layer perceptrons, linear transformations, softmax functions and basic probability.},

  abstract = {While the Transformer architecture has become the de-facto standard for natural language processing tasks, its applications to computer vision remain limited. In vision, attention is either applied in conjunction with convolutional networks, or used to replace certain components of convolutional networks while keeping their overall structure in place. We show that this reliance on CNNs is not necessary and a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can perform very well on image classification tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with {\textbackslash}textbf\{S\}hifted {\textbackslash}textbf\{win\}dows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures.

  abstract = {Transformer-based methods have shown impressive performance in image restoration tasks, such as image super-resolution and denoising. However, we find that these networks can only utilize a limited spatial range of input information through attribution analysis. This implies that the potential of Transformer is still not fully exploited in existing networks. In order to activate more input pixels for better restoration, we propose a new Hybrid Attention Transformer (HAT). It combines both channel attention and window-based self-attention schemes, thus making use of their complementary advantages. Moreover, to better aggregate the cross-window information, we introduce an overlapping cross-attention module to enhance the interaction between neighboring window features. In the training stage, we additionally adopt a same-task pre-training strategy to further exploit the potential of the model for further improvement. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed modules. We further scale up the model to show that the performance of the SR task can be greatly improved. Besides, we extend HAT to more image restoration applications, including real-world image super-resolution, Gaussian image denoising and image compression artifacts reduction. Experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate that our HAT achieves state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.

  abstract = {Convolutional neural network (CNN) depth is of crucial importance for image super-resolution (SR). However, we observe that deeper networks for image SR are more difficult to train. The low-resolution inputs and features contain abundant low-frequency information, which is treated equally across channels, hence hindering the representational ability of CNNs. To solve these problems, we propose the very deep residual channel attention networks (RCAN). Specifically, we propose a residual in residual (RIR) structure to form very deep network, which consists of several residual groups with long skip connections. Each residual group contains some residual blocks with short skip connections. Meanwhile, RIR allows abundant low-frequency information to be bypassed through multiple skip connections, making the main network focus on learning high-frequency information. Furthermore, we propose a channel attention mechanism to adaptively rescale channel-wise features by considering interdependencies among channels. Extensive experiments show that our RCAN achieves better accuracy and visual improvements against state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {Image restoration is a long-standing low-level vision problem that aims to restore high-quality images from low-quality images (e.g., downscaled, noisy and compressed images). While state-of-the-art image restoration methods are based on convolutional neural networks, few attempts have been made with Transformers which show impressive performance on high-level vision tasks. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline model SwinIR for image restoration based on the Swin Transformer. SwinIR consists of three parts: shallow feature extraction, deep feature extraction and high-quality image reconstruction. In particular, the deep feature extraction module is composed of several residual Swin Transformer blocks (RSTB), each of which has several Swin Transformer layers together with a residual connection. We conduct experiments on three representative tasks: image super-resolution (including classical, lightweight and real-world image super-resolution), image denoising (including grayscale and color image denoising) and JPEG compression artifact reduction. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinIR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on different tasks by \${\textbackslash}textbf\{up to 0.14\${\textbackslash}sim\$0.45dB\}\$, while the total number of parameters can be reduced by \${\textbackslash}textbf\{up to 67\%\}\$.},

  abstract = {Recently, CNN-based methods for hyperspectral image super-resolution (HSISR) have achieved outstanding performance. Due to the multi-band property of hyperspectral images, 3D convolutions are natural candidates for extracting spatial--spectral correlations. However, pure 3D CNN models are rare to see, since they are generally considered to be too complex, require large amounts of data to train, and run the risk of overfitting on relatively small-scale hyperspectral datasets. In this paper, we question this common notion and propose Full 3D U-Net (F3DUN), a full 3D CNN model combined with the U-Net architecture. By introducing skip connections, the model becomes deeper and utilizes multi-scale features. Extensive experiments show that F3DUN can achieve state-of-the-art performance on HSISR tasks, indicating the effectiveness of the full 3D CNN on HSISR tasks, thanks to the carefully designed architecture. To further explore the properties of the full 3D CNN model, we develop a 3D/2D mixed model, a popular kind of model prior, called Mixed U-Net (MUN) which shares a similar architecture with F3DUN. Through analysis on F3DUN and MUN, we find that 3D convolutions give the model a larger capacity; that is, the full 3D CNN model can obtain better results than the 3D/2D mixed model with the same number of parameters when it is sufficiently trained. Moreover, experimental results show that the full 3D CNN model could achieve competitive results with the 3D/2D mixed model on a small-scale dataset, suggesting that 3D CNN is less sensitive to data scaling than what people used to believe. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, CAVE and Harvard, demonstrate that our proposed F3DUN exceeds state-of-the-art HSISR methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.},

  abstract = {The hyperspectral image (HSI) distinguishes itself in material identification through its exceptional spectral resolution. However, its spatial resolution is constrained by hardware limitations, prompting the evolution of HSI super-resolution (SR) techniques. Single HSI SR endeavors to reconstruct high-spatial-resolution HSI from low-spatial-resolution inputs, and recent progress in deep learning-based algorithms has significantly advanced the quality of reconstructed images. However, convolutional methods struggle to extract comprehensive spatial and spectral features. Transformer-based models have yet to harness long-range dependencies across both dimensions fully, thus inadequately integrating spatial and spectral data. To solve the above problem, in this paper, we propose a new HSI SR method, SSAformer, which merges the strengths of CNNs and Transformers. It introduces specially designed attention mechanisms for HSI, including spatial and spectral attention modules, and overcomes the previous challenges in extracting and amalgamating spatial and spectral information. Evaluations on benchmark datasets show that SSAformer surpasses contemporary methods in enhancing spatial details and preserving spectral accuracy, underscoring its potential to expand HSI's utility in various domains, such as environmental monitoring and remote sensing.},

These CNN-based methods achieve impressive restoration performance while showing limitations in capturing the long-range dependencies and self-similarity prior. To cope with this problem, we propose a novel Transformer-based method, Multi-stage Spectral-wise Transformer (MST++), for efficient spectral reconstruction. In particular, we employ Spectral-wise Multi-head Self-attention (S-MSA) that is based on the HSI spatially sparse while spectrally self-similar nature to compose the basic unit, Spectral-wise Attention Block (SAB). Then SABs build up Single-stage Spectral-wise Transformer (SST) that exploits a U-shaped structure to extract multi-resolution contextual information. Finally, our MST++, cascaded by several SSTs, progressively improves the reconstruction quality from coarse to fine. Comprehensive experiments show that our MST++ significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. In the NTIRE 2022 Spectral Reconstruction Challenge, our approach won the First place.

  abstract = {Exploiting spatial-angular correlation is crucial to light field (LF) image super-resolution (SR), but is highly challenging due to its non-local property caused by the disparities among LF images. Although many deep neural networks (DNNs) have been developed for LF image SR and achieved continuously improved performance, existing methods cannot well leverage the long-range spatialangular correlation and thus suffer a significant performance drop when handling scenes with large disparity variations. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method to learn the non-local spatial-angular correlation for LF image SR. In our method, we adopt the epipolar plane image (EPI) representation to project the 4D spatialangular correlation onto multiple 2D EPI planes, and then develop a Transformer network with repetitive self-attention operations to learn the spatial-angular correlation by modeling the dependencies between each pair of EPI pixels. Our method can fully incorporate the information from all angular views while achieving a global receptive field along the epipolar line. We conduct extensive experiments with insightful visualizations to validate the effectiveness of our method. Comparative results on five public datasets show that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art SR performance but also performs robust to disparity variations.
